Mozilla wants to know if we can improve your experience when linking and transferring content between desktop and mobile devices. Participating in this study will help us find out!

## What will happen next

**If you agree** to participate:

1. We will add additional functionality to Firefox notifications.
2. Continue using Firefox as you normally would. You may not notice any changes immediately.
3. After 2 weeks, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.
4. We will ask you to fill out a quick optional survey to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

## Leaving the study

The study will expire on its own in 14 days.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:

1. Type `about:addons` into the location bar, and press enter.
2. Find `Get Synced` in the **extensions** list pane.
3. Click the `remove` button.
4. If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.

Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.

## Your privacy

### All Shield Studies

Every Shield Study collects data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.

This data is associated with [Firefox Telemetry collection](https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html).

### This Particular Study

In addition to the data collected by all Shield Studies and your voluntary answers to the followup survey, here are the **key things you should know** about what is happening when you participate in this study:

- We will count the number of bookmarks that you store in Firefox. We do not collect additional details such as bookmark names or URL data.
- We will count clicks to any browser notifications.
